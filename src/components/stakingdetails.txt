 Dear members of the Homergem Staking Community, We extend a warm
                welcome to all of you as you join our esteemed community of
                stakers. We highly value your participation and are committed to
                ensuring that you are well-informed about our staking rewards
                program, which provides enticing benefits tailored to your
                staking activities. To express our gratitude for your early
                support, we have designed a tiered staking rewards system that
                offers daily rewards based on your staking. This means that each
                day, you will receive rewards commensurate with your staking
                amount, providing you with ongoing incentives for your
                participation. For the first 0 to 99 stakers, we are excited to
                announce a generous daily reward rate of 8% of their total
                staking amount per year. This reflects our appreciation for the
                early adopters who have joined us on this exciting journey.
                Subsequently, stakers ranking from the 100th to the 199th
                position will enjoy a daily reward rate of 7.9%, ensuring that
                their contributions are recognized and rewarded accordingly. As
                we continue to progress, the reward rates will gradually
                decrease by 0.1% increments from the 200th staker onwards until
                the 800th staker. We want to assure you that every member of our
                community is highly valued, and our staking rewards system has
                been designed to be fair and competitive. By providing daily
                rewards, we aim to maximize the value you receive from your
                staking activities and foster an environment that encourages
                long-term participation and growth. Thank you for choosing
                Homergem as your staking platform. We appreciate your trust and
                look forward to your continued support as we embark on this
                rewarding journey together. It is important to note that once
                you select a staking duration, you will not be able to unstake
                before that predetermined duration has elapsed. This means that
                your staked funds will be locked and inaccessible until the
                selected duration is complete. While this lock-up period
                restricts immediate access to your funds, it is essential to
                understand that it is an integral part of our staking model. It
                enables us to maintain the stability and integrity of the
                system, as well as ensure a fair distribution of rewards to all
                participants.
